! This program will numerically compute the integral of
!                   4/(1+x*x) 
! from 0 to 1.  The value of this integral is pi -- which 
! is great since it gives us an easy way to check the answer.

! The is the original sequential program.  It uses the timer
! from the OpenMP runtime library
